PHP and MySQL project

The focus of the project was to build a small Content Management System that allows registered user to CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) content.
The result is visible at the public webpage. 

http://samim.com.np/prj/ (webpage is not available at this moment)shows the implemetation of the project. One requires credential to get into administrator page after which only editing of the public website can be done. 

CMS allows to crud new navigation subject, different pages, content to the pages and some more functionality. 

Missing here 
- constants.php - check from connection.php for the required constant.
- database with simple design as shown in below is required. The users table requires at least one priviledged account that could use this CMS.
